# Hello Welcome to Enrico-IT

I'm Enrico, and I'm trying to learn a little bit of programming.
I'm actually doing an apprenticeship as an IT system electronics technician, and I am in my third year.
I know it sounds a little bit odd for an IT system electronics technician to do programming, but somehow I have been interested in web development recently.

For me, it's really important to have a good work attitude. That means working hard, being cooperative, and showing interest in your work.

This programming journey of mine will showcase my projects, portfolio, and ideas from beginning to end. I would be happy if you could suggest improvements to my projects or point out my mistakes so that I can learn from them.
